        "extra": "This is a pile with 10 differently-named unique Knights with a single randomizer card. There is the same basic ability on each card, but also another ability unique to that card in the pile, and they all have different names. Follow the rules on Knights in order from top to bottom; Sir Michael causes players to discard before it trashes cards. The ability they have in common is, each other player reveals the top two cards of their deck, trashes one of them that they choose that costs from 3 Coin to 6 Coin, and discards the rest; then, if a Knight was trashed, you trash the Knight you played that caused this trashing. Resolve this ability in turn order, starting with the player to your left. Cards with Potion (from Alchemy) or Debt (from Empires) in the cost do not cost from 3 Coin to 6 Coin. The player losing a card only gets a choice if both cards revealed cost from 3 Coin to 6 Coin. If they both do and one is a Knight but the player picks the other card, that will not cause the played Knight to be trashed. When Sir Martin is the top card of the pile, it can be gained with an Armory and so on. If Sir Vander is trashed, you gain a Gold; this happens whether it is trashed on your turn or someone else's. The player who had Sir Vander is the one who gains the Gold, regardless of who played the card that trashed it. The Gold from Sir Vander, and the card gained for Dame Natalie, comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. When playing Dame Anna, you may choose to trash zero, one, or two cards from your hand. Dame Josephine is also a Victory card, worth 2 <VP> at the end of the game. The Knight pile is not a Victory pile, and does not get a counter for Trade Route (from Prosperity) even if Dame Josephine starts on top.  If you choose to use the Knights with Black Market (a promotional card), put a Knight directly into the Black Market deck, rather than using the randomizer card. Sir Martin only costs 4 Coins, though the other Knights all cost 5 Coins.",

So, for example, if you play Possession in a two player game, then after the Possession turn, that player still gets his normal turn. If he played Outpost during that turn though, it would not give him an extra turn. If you play both Outpost and Possession in the same turn, the Outpost turn happens first. If you make someone play Outpost during a turn in which you Possessed them, that player will get the extra turn and make decisions during it and so forth, not you; if you make someone play Possession during a turn in which you Possessed them, that will make that player Possess the player to his left, rather than you getting to Possess anyone further.

If you trash a card costing 0 coins, such as Copper, you will gain zero Silvers. You can trash Silver if you want; you will gain three Silvers for it normally. If costs are different, such as due to playing Highway, then Trader will give you a different number of Silvers, based on the current costs. For example if you play Highway and then Trader, trashing an Estate you will only gain one Silver. If you trash a card with Potion in its cost from Alchemy, you do not get anything for the Potion, just for the coins that the card cost. Trader is also a Reaction.

For example you can buy Farmland, trash a card from your hand and gain one costing 2 more, then use Trader to gain Silver rather than Farmland.

For example, if you play a Highway (from Hinterlands) and use Way of the Sheep, you get +2 Coin, and then while Highway is in play, its ability makes cards cheaper. For tracking, it is helpful to tilt a card that was played using a Way, so that you remember that it did the Way instead of what it says.

Enchantress from Empires also changes what an Action card does when played. If you are affected by Enchantress, you can use a Way instead of getting the +1 Card and +1 Action that Enchantress's effect would give you.

If it does stay in play, you will have to remember for your next turn how many times you actually played the Duration card for its abilities.

If all Hexes have been used, shuffle the discards to reform the deck; do this whenever the deck is empty. Received Hexes always go to the Hexes discard pile. Hexes are never in a player's deck; they are physically cards but are not 'cards' in game terms. They are thus never 'cards in play,' receiving Hexes is not 'gaining a card,' and so on. With the exception of the following, most Hexes are so simple that they do not need additional explanation.\n<u>Bad Omens</u>: Normally you will end up with a deck consisting of two Coppers, and a discard pile with the rest of your cards. Sometimes you will only have one or no Coppers; in those cases reveal your deck to demonstrate this.\n<u>Delusion</u>: Deluded / Envious is two-sided; take it with the Deluded side face up.\n<u>Envy</u>: Deluded / Envious is two-sided; take it with the Envious side face up.\n<u>Famine</u>: The revealed cards that are not Actions are shuffled back into your deck.\n<u>Fear</u>: You discard an Action or Treasure if you have either, and only reveal your hand if you have no Actions and no Treasures.\n<u>Locusts</u>: Types are the words on the bottom banner, like Action and Attack. If there is no cheaper card that shares a type - for example if the card trashed is Curse - the player does not gain anything.\n<u>Misery</u>: If this hits you for a third time in a game, nothing will happen; you stay at Twice Miserable.\n<u>War</u>: If you do not find a card costing 3 Coins or 4 Coins, your entire deck will end up in your discard pile, with nothing trashed.",

Playing an Action card for a Way ability means not doing anything the Action card said to do when played. For example, if you have Way of the Sheep in a game, which says \"+2 Coin,\" then you could play a Horse and choose to get +2 Coin; if you did so, you would not get +2 Cards and +1 Action, and would not return the Horse to its pile. Ways are not Kingdom cards, and cannot be bought; they sit on the table modifying the game rules. Text below a dividing line is unaffected, it will still happen whenever it says it does. For example, if you play a Highway (from Hinterlands) and use Way of the Sheep, you get +2 Coin, and then while Highway is in play, its ability makes cards cheaper. For tracking, it is helpful to tilt a card that was played using a Way, so that you remember that it did the Way instead of what it says. Some Ways refer to \"this.\" That is the card being used to do the Way ability. For example, Way of the Turtle says \"Set this aside...\" If you play a Market using Way of the Turtle, you will set the Market aside. Enchantress from Empires also changes what an Action card does when played. If you are affected by Enchantress, you can use a Way instead of getting the +1 Card and +1 Action that Enchantress's effect would give you. When an Action card can be played at an unusual time, like Sheepdog, it can still be used as a Way. If you play an Action card multiple times, with a card like Mastermind, you can choose for each play whether you want it to use a Way or not. If the card you are playing is a Duration card, it only stays in play if at least one of its plays was for its own abilities. If it does stay in play, you will have to remember for your next turn how many times you actually played the Duration card for its abilities. The choice to use a Way or not happens after \"first\" abilities on cards like Moat and Kiln. The Adventures tokens from Adventures still apply when playing a card using a Way.
