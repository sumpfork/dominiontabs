If you use Band of Misfits as a Throne Room (from Dominion), King's Court (from Prosperity), or Procession, and use that effect to play a duration card, Band of Misfits will similarly stay in play. If you use Throne Room, King's Court, or Procession to play a Band of Misfits card multiple times, you only pick what to play it as the first time; the other times it is still copying the same card.

If you use Band of Misfits as a card that does something during Clean-up, such as Hermit, it will do that thing during Clean-up.

It also does not function during Clean-up, when you normally discard all of your played and unplayed cards. The key thing to look for is a card actually telling you to \"discard\" cards. The Gold you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile; if there is no Gold left in the Supply, you do not gain one.",

So, for example, if you play Possession in a two player game, then after the Possession turn, that player still gets his normal turn. If he played Outpost during that turn though, it would not give him an extra turn. If you play both Outpost and Possession in the same turn, the Outpost turn happens first. If you make someone play Outpost during a turn in which you Possessed them, that player will get the extra turn and make decisions during it and so forth, not you; if you make someone play Possession during a turn in which you Possessed them, that will make that player Possess the player to his left, rather than you getting to Possess anyone further. Possession turns (and other extra turns) do not count for the tiebreaker. Once the game ends, no further turns are played, including extra turns from Possession and Outpost. -Unlike Outpost, Possession is not a Duration card. It is discarded in the Clean-up phase of the turn you played it. [Possession also gives the Possessing player all tokens the Possessed player would get, including _ Coins, <VP>, and Debt tokens.]",
