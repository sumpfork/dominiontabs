However, for reference, Ways' effects are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with light blue frames.</justify>";"Each Way gives Action cards an additional option: you can play the Action for what it normally does, or play it to do what the Way says to do. Playing an Action card for a Way ability means not doing anything the Action card said to do when played.

For example, if you play a Highway (from Hinterlands) and use Way of the Sheep, you get +2 Coin, and then while Highway is in play, its ability makes cards cheaper.

Enchantress from Empires also changes what an Action card does when played. If you are affected by Enchantress, you can use a Way instead of getting the +1 Card and +1 Action that Enchantress's effect would give you. When an Action card can be played at an unusual time, like Sheepdog, it can still be used as a Way. If you play an Action card multiple times, with a card like Mastermind, you can choose for each play whether you want it to use a Way or not. If the card you are playing is a Duration card, it only stays in play if at least one of its plays was for its own abilities. If it does stay in play, you will have to remember for your next turn how many times you actually played the Duration card for its abilities. The choice to use a Way or not happens after \""first\"" abilities on cards like Moat and Kiln. The Adventures tokens from Adventures still apply when playing a card using a Way.

;"menagerie events";;;;;"Events - Menagerie";"<justify>Events are not Kingdom cards. In a player's Buy phase, when the player can buy a card, the player can buy an Event instead. Buying an Event means paying the cost indicated on the Event and then doing the effect of the Event. The Event just stays on the table, the player does not take it; there is no way for a player to gain one or end up with one in his deck. Buying an Event uses up a Buy; normally a player can either buy a card, or buy an Event. A player with two Buys, such as after playing Ranger, could buy two cards, or buy two Events, or buy a card and an Event (in either order). The same Event can be bought multiple times in a turn if the player has the Buys and available to do it. Some Events give +Buys and so let the player buy further cards/Events afterwards. Players cannot play further Treasures that turn after buying an Event. Buying an Event is not buying a card and so does not trigger cards like Swamp Hag or Goons (from Prosperity). Costs of Events are not affected by cards like Bridge Troll.</justify>";"Events are special on-buy effects not attached to cards. Players can buy Events during their Buy phase to trigger whatever the effect of the Event is, as an alternative to (or in addition to) buying cards from the supply.<n>Events are not Kingdom cards; including one or more Events in a game does not count toward the 10 Kingdom card piles the supply includes. In fact, Events are not considered \""cards\"" at all. Any text referring to a \""card\"" (such as instructions to \""name a card\"", or cost reducers changing the cost of cards) does not apply to Events. However, for reference, the Event effects and costs are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with silver frames.<n>Any number of Events may be used in a game, but the recommendation is to not use more than two total Events and Landmarks. When choosing a random Kingdom, the Events may be shuffled into the randomizer deck; any Events that are dealt once 10 Kingdom cards have also been dealt will be included in the game. "
