  "extra": " When you play this, you pick an Action card from the Supply that costs less than it, and treat this card as if it were the card you chose. Normally this will just mean that you follow the instructions on the card you picked. So, if you play Band of Misfits and Fortress is in the Supply, you could pick that and then you would draw a card and get +2 Actions, since that is what Fortress does when you play it. Band of Misfits also gets the chosen card's cost, name, and types. If you use Band of Misfits as a card that trashes itself, such as Death Cart, you will trash the Band of Misfits (at which point it will just be a Band of Misfits card in the trash). If you use Band of Misfits as a duration card (from Seaside), Band of Misfits will stay in play until next turn, just like the duration card would. If you use Band of Misfits as a Throne Room (from Dominion), King's Court (from Prosperity), or Procession, and use that effect to play a duration card, Band of Misfits will similarly stay in play. If you use Throne Room, King's Court, or Procession to play a Band of Misfits card multiple times, you only pick what to play it as the first time; the other times it is still copying the same card. For example, if you use Procession to play Band of Misfits twice and choose Fortress the first time, you will automatically replay it as Fortress, then trash the Band of Misfits, return it to your hand (it is a Fortress when it's trashed, and Fortress has a when-trashed ability that returns it to your hand), and gain an Action card costing exactly 6 Coins(1 Coin more than Band of Misfits, which has left play and so is no longer copying Fortress). If you use Band of Misfits as a card that does something during Clean-up, such as Hermit, it will do that thing during Clean-up. When you play Horn of Plenty (from Cornucopia), it counts Band of Misfits as whatever Band of Misfits was played as; for example if you play a Band of Misfits as a Fortress, and then play another Band of Misfits as a Scavenger, and then play Horn of Plenty, you will gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. Band of Misfits can only be played as a card that is visible in the Supply; it cannot be played as a card after its pile runs out, and cannot be played as a non-Supply card like Mercenary; it can be played as the top card of the Ruins pile, but no other Ruins, and can only be played as Sir Martin when that is the top card of the Knights pile",

An Estate is yours if either it started in your deck, or you gained it or bought it, or you were passed it with Masquerade (from Intrigue). An Estate stops being yours if you trash it, return it to the Supply, pass it with Masquerade, or are stopped from gaining it due to Possession (from Alchemy) or Trader (from Hinterlands). There are no limits on the set aside card other than being a non-Victory Action from the Supply costing up to 4 Coins; it may be a Duration card, a Reaction card, and so on.

  "extra": "When you play this, you pick an Action card from the Supply that costs up to 5 Coin, and treat this card as if it were the card you chose. Normally this will just mean that you follow the instructions on the card you picked. For example, with Village in the Supply, you could play Overlord as Village and get +1 Card +2 Actions. Overlord also gets the chosen card's cost, name, and types, until it leaves play. If you play Overlord as a card that moves itself somewhere, such as to the trash or the Supply, Overlord will do that; for example Overlord played as Encampment will be set aside and return to the Overlord pile at the start of Clean-up. If you play Overlord as a Duration card, or as a Throne Room on a Duration card, Overlord will stay in play the same way the Duration card or Throne Room would. If you play an Overlord multiple times such as via a Throne Room, you will only pick what to play it as the first time; the other times it will be the same thing. Once in play, Overlord is the thing it copied, rather than an Overlord; for example Colonnade will produce <VP> if you buy a copy of that card, but not if you buy an Overlord. Overlord can only be played as a visible card in the Supply, and the top card of a pile; it cannot be played as a card from an empty pile, or as a card that has not been uncovered from a split pile, or as a card from a split pile that has been bought out, or as a non-Supply card (like Mercenary from Dominion: Dark Ages). Overlord cannot be played as Crown during a Buy phase, since Overlord itself is not a Treasure and so cannot be played in Buy phases.",
