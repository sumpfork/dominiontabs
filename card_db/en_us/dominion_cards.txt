Any cards he would gain on that turn, you gain instead; any cards of his that are trashed are set aside and returned to his discard pile at end of turn.
14	Possession 2/2	Alchemy	Action	$6 1P	-During the Possessed turn, whenever one of that player's cards is trashed, set it aside, and that player puts it into his discard pile at the end of the turn, after Clean-up. This counts as the card being trashed, so, for example, you could trash a Mining Village (from Intrigue) and get the 2 coins. Getting those cards back at end of turn does not count as those cards being gained (so for example, you won't get them). Other players' cards that are trashed during that turn are not returned.
-If you make another player play an Attack via Possession, that Attack will hit you like it would normally. If you want to use a Reaction in response to that Attack (such as Secret Chamber from Intrigue), you would be the one revealing the Reaction, not the player being Possessed.
-Possession is cumulative; if you play it twice in one turn, there will be two extra turns after this one.
-Cards passed with Masquerade (from Intrigue) are not being gained or trashed, and so are passed normally. Cards returned to the Supply with Ambassador (from Seaside) are also not being trashed, and so return to the Supply normally.

If you do, you gain a Mercenary. If there are no Mercenaries left you do not gain one. If you play the same Urchin twice in one turn, such as via Procession, that does not let you trash it for a Mercenary. If you play two different Urchins however, playing the second one will let you trash the first one.
44	Hermit / Madman	Dark Ages Extras	Action	$3	Hermit: When you play this, look through your discard pile, and then you may choose to trash a card that is not a Treasure, from either your hand or your discard pile.

After trashing or not, you gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Gaining a card is mandatory if it is possible. Then, when you discard Hermit from play - normally, in Clean-up, after playing it in your Action phase - if you did not buy any cards this turn, you trash Hermit and gain a Madman. It does not matter whether or not you gained cards other ways, only whether or not you bought a card. If there are no Madman cards left, you do not gain one. If Hermit is not discarded from play during Clean-up - for example, if you put it on your deck with Scheme (from Hinterlands) - then the ability that trashes it will not trigger.

59	Events	Adventures Extras	Event	$*	Events are not Kingdom cards. In a player’s Buy phase, when the player can buy a card, the player can buy an Event instead. Buying an Event means paying the cost indicated on the Event and then doing the effect of the Event. The Event just stays on the table, the player does not take it; there is no way for a player to gain one or end up with one in his deck. Buying an Event uses up a Buy; normally a player can either buy a card, or buy an Event. A player with two Buys, such as after playing Ranger, could buy two cards, or buy two Events, or buy a card and an Event (in either order). The same Event can be bought multiple times in a turn if the player has the Buys and available to do it. Some Events give +Buys and so let the player buy further cards/Events afterwards. Players cannot play further Treasures that turn after buying an Event. Buying an Event is not buying a card and so does not trigger cards like Swamp Hag or Goons (from Prosperity). Costs of Events are not affected by cards like Bridge Troll.
