Buying an Event uses up a Buy; normally a player can either buy a card, or buy an Event. A player with two Buys, such as after playing Ranger, could buy two cards, or buy two Events, or buy a card and an Event (in either order). The same Event can be bought multiple times in a turn if the player has the Buys and available to do it. Some Events give +Buys and so let the player buy further cards/Events afterwards. Players cannot play further Treasures that turn after buying an Event. Buying an Event is not buying a card and so does not trigger cards like Swamp Hag or Goons (from Prosperity). Costs of Events are not affected by cards like Bridge Troll."
