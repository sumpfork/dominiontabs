        "extra": "When you play this, you pick an Action card from the Supply that costs less than it, and treat this card as if it were the card you chose. Normally this will just mean that you follow the instructions on the card you picked. So, if you play Band of Misfits and Fortress is in the Supply, you could pick that and then you would draw a card and get +2 Actions, since that is what Fortress does when you play it. Band of Misfits also gets the chosen card's cost, name, and types. If you use Band of Misfits as a card that trashes itself, such as Death Cart, you will trash the Band of Misfits (at which point it will just be a Band of Misfits card in the trash). If you use Band of Misfits as a duration card (from Seaside), Band of Misfits will stay in play until next turn, just like the duration card would. If you use Band of Misfits as a Throne Room (from Dominion), King's Court (from Prosperity), or Procession, and use that effect to play a duration card, Band of Misfits will similarly stay in play. If you use Throne Room, King's Court, or Procession to play a Band of Misfits card multiple times, you only pick what to play it as the first time; the other times it is still copying the same card. For example, if you use Procession to play Band of Misfits twice and choose Fortress the first time, you will automatically replay it as Fortress, then trash the Band of Misfits, return it to your hand (it is a Fortress when it's trashed, and Fortress has a when-trashed ability that returns it to your hand), and gain an Action card costing exactly 6 Coins(1 Coin more than Band of Misfits, which has left play and so is no longer copying Fortress). If you use Band of Misfits as a card that does something during Clean-up, such as Hermit, it will do that thing during Clean-up. When you play Horn of Plenty (from Cornucopia), it counts Band of Misfits as whatever Band of Misfits was played as; for example if you play a Band of Misfits as a Fortress, and then play another Band of Misfits as a Scavenger, and then play Horn of Plenty, you will gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. Band of Misfits can only be played as a card that is visible in the Supply; it cannot be played as a card after its pile runs out, and cannot be played as a non-Supply card like Mercenary; it can be played as the top card of the Ruins pile, but no other Ruins, and can only be played as Sir Martin when that is the top card of the Knights pile",

You may choose to discard zero cards, but then you will get zero additional coins. The other ability does nothing at that time as it is only used as a Reaction. When someone else plays an Attack card, you may reveal Secret Chamber from your hand. If you do, first you draw 2 cards, then you put at 2 cards from your hand on top of your deck (in any order). The cards you put back do not have to be the ones you drew. You can put Secret Chamber itself on top of your deck; it's still on your hand when you reveal it. Revealing Secret Chamber happens prior to resolving what an Attack does to you. For example, if another player plays Thief, you can reveal Secret Chamber, draw 2 cards, put 2 back, and then you resolve getting hit by the Thief. You can reveal Secret Chamber whenever another player plays an Attack card, even if that Attack would not affect you. Also, you can reveal more than one Reaction card in response to an Attack. For example, after revealing the Secret Chamber in response to an Attack and resolving the effect of the Secret Chamber, you can still reveal a Moat to avoid the Attack completely.",
